I have done the following in the modified unit tests:

(i) For C# Unit Test project, I have done the application using .NET Core 3.1 Framework
(ii) Under new C# project, I have removed unused codes that were there in initial project (that is present under bitbucket).
(iii) The Java Unit Test project present in bitbucket contains errors. I have modifed the java project, removed the errors as well as the unused codes.
